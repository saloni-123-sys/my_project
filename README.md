# Trader Behavior vs Market Sentiment Analysis


This project explores the relationship between **trader behavior** and **market sentiment** (Fear & Greed Index) using two datasets:
1. **Bitcoin Market Sentiment Dataset** – sentiment classifications (Fear, Greed, Extreme Greed, Neutral).
2. **Historical Trader Data from Hyperliquid** – trader activity including leverage, volume, trade size, and closed PnL.

The objective is to analyze whether trading behavior aligns or diverges from market sentiment and uncover hidden trends that could inform better trading strategies.
